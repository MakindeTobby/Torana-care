                            This support assists a participant to implement their plan by strengthening their ability to connect with the broader systems of supports and to understand the purpose of the funded supports. Our Support Connection assists a participant to understand their NDIS plan, connect participants with broader systems of supports, and provide assistance to connect with providers. This service will also assist participants
                             to achieve effective utilisation of their NDIS plan and answer questions as they arise.

                    <span>
                    This support strengthens a participant’s ability to design and then build their supports with an emphasis on linking the broader systems of support across a complex service delivery environment. Our Coordination of Supports  focuses on supporting participants to direct their lives, not just their services, and also focuses on assisting participants to build and maintain a resilient network of formal and informal supports. This involves working together with the participant to understand the funding, identify what participants expect from services, and how participants want this designed. This service also includes 
                    coaching participants, and working with participants to develop capacity and resilience in their network.
