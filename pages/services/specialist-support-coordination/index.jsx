                    Our Specialist Support Coordination is generally delivered through an intensive and time limited period necessitated by the participant’s immediate and significant barriers to plan implementation. Depending on individual circumstances, our Specialist Support Coordinator may also design a complex service plan that focuses on how all the stakeholders in a participant’s life will interact to resolve barriers and promote appropriate plan implementation. Once developed, our Specialist Support Coordinator will continue to monitor the plan, 
                    which may be maintained by the participant’s support workers or other care supports.
